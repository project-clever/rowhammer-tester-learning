# Tasks

## Model

- [ ] Output quantitative information besides hammering results, for instance "Flip : 0.9" meaning that bitflips occur with 90% probability

## Adapter

- [ ] Handle non-determinism **(Omar)**
  - [ ] Modify synthetic model so that it simulates non-deterministic bit-flips
  - [ ] Implement Sampler component which repeats tests several times and summarises results
- [ ] Have adapter use rowhammer tester to run appropriate tests (e.g., generate JSON files for rowhammer tester)
- [ ] Collect results and translate it back for Learner

## Rowhammer tester

- [ ] Implement tests for triggering bit flips **(Kamil)**
  - [ ] Investigate correct implementation of one-sided/two-sided hammering: do we need to hammer a "distant row" in one-sided so that the current row is closed?
- [ ] Implement tests for detecting TRR
  - See [[1]](#1) and [[2]](#2)
- [ ] Implement tests for detecting ECC
  - on-chip ECC can only be found in DDR5?

## FPGA

- [ ] Implement basic TRR
  - Look at "rowhammer-tester/third_party/litedram/litedram/core/refresher.py" for a refresher module

## Misc/extensions

- [ ] Implement tool to measure retention time and select adjacent rows with similar retention times **(Kamil)**
- [ ] Control temperature and/or represent it in the model

## Scholarship

- [ ] Keep abreast of related  and fast moving literature (maybe have file for collecting this?)
  - [ ] Rowhammer itself
  - [ ] Rowhammer defenses
  - [ ] Active learning
- [ ] Think about potential conferences for publication
- [ ] Think about getting funding for longer range work in this direction
